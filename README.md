Images can only be used for testing, all of them are collected from the Internet.  
Just execute ***RemoveWatermark.py*** and wait for a while you will get the watermark-free images in the ***TestImages\output*** folder(This is a initial version so it runs very slow).  
note: It was designed only for grey scale images, with black content and grey watermarks, and you can change the boundary value of watermark color
